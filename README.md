🚀 NessDumper - ⚠️  Turkish VALVe for their 2013 edition of the Source SDK and also the leaked version from 2007 ⚠️ 

Since in the past the signature for the LocalPlayer was broken a few times and/or pointed to something wrong, 
I want to offer you an alternative. All required offsets are already in the repo, why 99% of people don't use them is 
questionable - or they are just too incompetent and complain that nothing works, but they can't find a single signature themselves. 
However, pretty much every hack uses the entity list (dwEntityList) and also ClientState (dwClientState). 
All you need is a third offset which is located

in ClientState, called dwClientState_GetLocalPlayer.

const auto client_state = read_memory<std::uint32_t>( engine_image->base + nessdumper::signatures::dwClientState );
if( client_state ) {
    const auto local_player = get_client_entity( 
        read_memory<std::int32_t>( client_state + nessdumper::signatures::dwClientState_GetLocalPlayer )
    );

    if( local_player ) {
        printf(
            "[+] Found local player: 0x%X, health: %d\n",
            local_player,
            read_memory<std::int32_t>( local_player + nessdumper::netvars::m_iHealth )
        );
    }
}
